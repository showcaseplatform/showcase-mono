☐ add focus on next form input on submit editing
☐ path aliases to 'components', 'utils', etc.
☐ RN-styledcomps vs RN-paper theming vs unthemed space/sizing should use the same theme file / format (spacing with and without 'px' )
☐ detailed camera / image gallery permission implementation
☐ Lift Editor's state into a separate Context (choosen category, imagePath, maybe filter settings as well)
☐ BadgeDetails screen loading states handling
  ☐ load cause image
  ☐ load main image
  ☐ load image background
  ☐ header data must be there when images loaded
☐ Profile screen should handle longer (~infinite) bio text
☐ MyFriend screen items may navigate to user's profile
☐ Edit User Profile cache handling into client
☐ Badge list footer could be look nicer or offer some functionality eg.: follow more creators

*** QUESTIONS ***
☐ Where should we navigate back from Profile screen (other user's profile)?
☐ Profile screen -> open badge -> onBack: where to?
☐ edit user profile image -> upload on 'Save' or asap as picked?
☐ If logged in user is Verified Creator -> Trade Stack is active -> how will bottomsheet will behave (curr: custom asset colored Create button)
☐ trading
  - own 1 badge only?
  - creator inventory control? more items, sell only few from them
  - after selling state badge -> modify sell details
